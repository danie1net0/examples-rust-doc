# 1. Getting started

## 1.1. Installation

### Installing on Linux or MacOS
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Updating and uninstalling

To update:
```
rustup update
```

To uninstall:
```
rustup self uninstall
```

### Local documentation
```
rustup doc
```

## 1.2. Running and compiling

### Running a Rust program

To compile the program:
```
rustc main.rs
```

To run the binary:
```
./main
```

## 1.3. Cargo

### Creating a project:
```
cargo new project_name
```

### Building and running:
To build the project:
```
cargo build
```

To run the binary:
```
./target/debug/project_name
```

To run the project without compile and execute in different steps:
```
cargo run
```

To quickly checks the code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable:
```
cargo check
```

### Building for release:
To compile the project with optimizations: 
```
cargo build --release
```

# 2. Common programming concepts

## 2.1. Variables and mutability

### Variables
Are immutables by default
  * Are preceded by the `let` keyword: `let x: u8 = 4;`
  * Must be in snake case pattern: `let some_var: u8 = 5;`
  * The keyword `mut` should be used to define a variable as mutable

### Constants
Are always immutables, it is never possible to change their value

  * Can be used in global scope
  * May be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime
  * Are preceded by the `const` keyword: `const X: u8 = 4;`
  * Must be in all uppercase with underscores between words: `const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;`

### Shadowing
Are declared as a new variable with the same name as a previous variable:
```
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

* Result in a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword
* Effectively creates a new variable
* The type can't be changed, unlike the `let` keyword

## 2.2. Compound types

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

### Tuple type

A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

```
fn main() {
    let tuple: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

### Array type

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

```
fn main() {
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

## 2.3. Statements and Expressions

**Statements** are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value:
```
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

**Expressions** evaluate to a resultant value:
```
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

The expression:
```
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```
